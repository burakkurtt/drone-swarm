# drone-swarm

DroneSwarm is a last year project for swarm behaviour simulation in an obstructed environment implemented in C++. It provides an environement for :

- Adding moving objects linked together (swarm)
- Defining a target that the drones will try to reach
- Setting up a solid environement

# Features to be improved

Some methods of the simulators could be improved and optimised to speed up computation time and boost performance. Better path finding algorithm could be used also : 

- Path finding algorithm
- Acceleration in movement for continuous speed
- Mouse interface for environement definition
